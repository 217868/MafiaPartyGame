# Mafia Party

A real time web application written using Vue.js, .NET Core and SignalR library.

## About

Players connect to a generated host room using their mobile phones and start a game of Mafia.
The rules are based on the popular party game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)), but in contrast to the standard version,
this one does not require a host player to be excluded from the game. In fact, the whole game is managed by the host computer,
which describes the current events and informs players about the results of the voting.
